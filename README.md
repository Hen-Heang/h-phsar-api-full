## Security Flow — How It Works Step by Step

### STEP 1 — Register `POST /authorization/register`

```
Client sends: { email, password, roleId }
        │
        ▼
JwtAuthenticationController.insertUser()
        │
        ▼
JwtUserDetailsServiceImpl.insertUser()
        ├── Validate roleId is 1 (DISTRIBUTOR) or 2 (RETAILER)
        ├── Validate email format (regex)
        ├── Check duplicate email in tb_distributor_account OR tb_retailer_account
        ├── BCrypt encode the password
        └── INSERT INTO tb_distributor_account / tb_retailer_account
            is_verified = FALSE by default  ← account locked until OTP verified

Returns: AppUserDto (id, email, roleId)
```

---

### STEP 2 — Verify Email with OTP

#### Generate OTP `POST /authorization/api/v1/otp/generate`
```
Client sends: email
        │
        ▼
OtpServiceImplV1.generateOtp()
        ├── Find user in tb_distributor_account OR tb_retailer_account
        ├── Generate random 4-digit number (1000–9999)
        ├── EmailService.sendSimpleMail()  → sends OTP code to user's email
        └── INSERT INTO tb_distributor_otp / tb_retailer_otp  (with timestamp)
```

#### Verify OTP `POST /authorization/api/v1/otp/verify`
```
Client sends: otp (4-digit), email
        │
        ▼
OtpServiceImplV1.verifyOtp()
        ├── Check user is NOT already verified
        ├── Load user + latest OTP from DB
        ├── Check: email matches
        ├── Check: OTP code matches
        ├── Check: created_date < 3 minutes ago  ← expired if older
        └── UPDATE tb_distributor_account SET is_verified = TRUE

Account is now ACTIVE and can log in.
```

---

### STEP 3 — Login `POST /authorization/login`

```
Client sends: { email, password }
        │
        ▼
JwtAuthenticationController.createAuthenticationToken()
        │
        ├── Check is_verified = TRUE in DB
        │       └── if FALSE → auto-send new OTP and return 409
        │
        ├── AuthenticationManager.authenticate()
        │       └── DaoAuthenticationProvider
        │               ├── loadUserByUsername(email)  → fetch AppUser from DB
        │               └── BCrypt.matches(rawPassword, hashedPassword)
        │                       └── if wrong → 400 INVALID_PASSWORD
        │
        ├── JwtTokenUtil.generateToken()
        │       └── Build JWT: subject=email, expiry=24h, signed with HS512
        ├── getRoleIdByMail(email)
        └── getUserIdByMail(email)

Returns: { token, roleId, userId }
```

---

### STEP 4 — Every Protected API Request

```
Client sends: Authorization: Bearer <token>
        │
        ▼
CorsFilterConfiguration       ← Allow cross-origin request from browser
        │
        ▼
JwtRequestFilter
        ├── Extract token from "Bearer <token>" header
        ├── JwtTokenUtil.getUsernameFromToken()  → decode email from token
        │       └── if invalid/tampered → return 401 immediately
        ├── loadUserByUsername(email)  → fetch user from DB
        └── JwtTokenUtil.validateToken()
                ├── email in token == email in DB?
                └── token not expired?
                        └── if OK → set user as authenticated
        │
        ▼
SecurityConfig — check role permission
        ├── /api/v1/distributor/**  → requires DISTRIBUTOR role (roleId = 1)
        ├── /api/v1/retailer/**     → requires RETAILER role    (roleId = 2)
        └── wrong role → 403 | no token → 401 JSON (JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint)
        │
        ▼
Controller → Business Logic
```

---

### STEP 5 — Change Password & Forget Password

```
── Change Password (requires login token) ────────────────────
PUT /authorization/change-password
        ├── BCrypt.matches(oldPassword, storedHash)  ← verify old password
        ├── BCrypt.encode(newPassword)
        └── UPDATE password in DB

── Forget Password (no token needed, uses OTP) ───────────────
PUT /authorization/forget?otp=1234&email=...&newPassword=...
        ├── Load user + latest OTP from DB
        ├── Check: OTP code matches
        ├── Check: OTP created < 3 minutes ago
        ├── BCrypt.encode(newPassword)
        └── UPDATE password in DB
```

---

## Code Review & Improvement Plan

> This section documents the findings from a full codebase review. Items are grouped by priority. Each item explains **what** the problem is and **why** it matters.

---

### Group A — Security (Critical)

These issues can cause data breaches, unauthorized access, or exploitable vulnerabilities in production.

#### A1. Weak default JWT secret
- **What:** `application.properties` has `jwt.secret=JwtSuperSecretHahaKidding` as the fallback value.
- **Why:** If the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable is not set, any attacker who reads the source code (e.g., from a public repo) can forge valid JWT tokens and impersonate any user.
- **Fix:** Remove the default value. Force the app to fail on startup if `JWT_SECRET` is not provided.

#### A2. Weak default database password
- **What:** `spring.datasource.password=${DB_PASSWORD:123}` defaults to `"123"`.
- **Why:** Any exposed database port becomes trivially accessible. Even in development, weak defaults create bad habits.
- **Fix:** Remove the default. Require the `DB_PASSWORD` env var to be set explicitly.

#### A3. CORS allows all origins
- **What:** `CorsFilterConfiguration.java` uses `allowedOriginPatterns("*")`, allowing any domain to call the API.
- **Why:** This disables the browser's Same-Origin Policy protection entirely. In production, malicious websites can make cross-origin requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Fix:** Restrict to specific trusted domains via an env var (e.g., `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`).

#### A4. Outdated JWT library (jjwt 0.9.1 from 2018)
- **What:** `pom.xml` depends on `io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt:0.9.1`.
- **Why:** This version is 6+ years old, has known issues, and uses a deprecated API. The current version is `0.12.x` with a significantly improved and safer API.
- **Fix:** Upgrade to `jjwt-api`, `jjwt-impl`, and `jjwt-jackson` at version `0.12.x`.

#### A5. `AlreadyExistException` returns HTTP 404 instead of 409
- **What:** The `AlreadyExistException` class is mapped to HTTP status `404 Not Found`.
- **Why:** 404 means "resource not found." A duplicate/conflict should return `409 Conflict`. Incorrect status codes confuse API consumers and make error handling on the client side unreliable.
- **Fix:** Change the HTTP status to `409 CONFLICT`.

---

### Group B — Code Quality (High)

These issues reduce reliability, make the codebase harder to maintain, and can cause silent bugs.

#### B1. No request validation
- **What:** Controller methods accept request body DTOs but none have `@Valid`. DTO fields have no `@NotNull`, `@NotBlank`, `@Size`, or `@Email` constraints.
- **Why:** Invalid or malformed input (empty strings, null fields, invalid emails) reaches the service layer and database without being rejected. This causes cryptic errors and potential data corruption.
- **Fix:** Add `jakarta.validation` annotations to all request DTOs and `@Valid` to all controller method parameters.

#### B2. Dockerfile JAR name mismatch
- **What:** The Dockerfile references `warehouse_master-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` but `pom.xml` defines the artifact as `stock-flow-commerce-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
- **Why:** The Docker image will fail to build or start because the JAR it tries to run does not exist.
- **Fix:** Update the Dockerfile `COPY` and `ENTRYPOINT` to use the correct artifact ID.

#### B3. No database migration tool
- **What:** Database schema is managed through raw SQL files (`table.sql`, `create_all_tables.sql`) that must be run manually. Two OTP tables are created at runtime in `DatabaseInitializer.java`.
- **Why:** There is no way to track which schema version the database is at, apply incremental changes safely, or roll back a bad migration. Teams working together will get out of sync.
- **Fix:** Integrate **Flyway** and convert all SQL scripts into versioned migration files (e.g., `V1__init_schema.sql`).

#### B4. Duplicate `ApiResponse` class
- **What:** There are two separate `ApiResponse` classes — one in `common/api/` and one in `model/`.
- **Why:** Developers may import the wrong one, causing inconsistent API responses. It also creates confusion about which one to use.
- **Fix:** Delete the `model/ApiResponse.java` duplicate. Use only `common/api/ApiResponse.java` everywhere.

#### B5. Inconsistent service implementation naming
- **What:** Service implementations use mixed suffixes: `ServiceImplV1`, `ServiceImp`, `ServiceImpleV1`, `ServiceImpl`.
- **Why:** Inconsistency makes the codebase harder to navigate and signals a lack of conventions, which slows onboarding.
- **Fix:** Standardize all to `*ServiceImpl`.

#### B6. Two `DateTimeUtil` classes
- **What:** Both `DateTimeUtils.java` (in `common/utils/`) and `DateTimeUtil.java` (in `utils/`) exist with overlapping functionality.
- **Why:** Developers don't know which one to use. Logic may diverge over time.
- **Fix:** Merge into a single `DateTimeUtils.java` in `common/utils/`.

---

### Group C — Observability (Medium)

These issues make it very hard to debug problems and monitor the application in production.

#### C1. No `@Transactional` on service methods
- **What:** Service methods that perform multiple database writes (e.g., placing an order, updating product stock) do not use `@Transactional`.
- **Why:** If the second write fails after the first succeeds, the database is left in a corrupt/partial state with no automatic rollback.
- **Fix:** Annotate all service methods that involve multiple DB operations with `@Transactional`.

#### C2. No structured logging
- **What:** The service layer has little to no logging. `@Slf4j` is not consistently used.
- **Why:** When something goes wrong in production, there are no logs to trace what happened. Debugging becomes guesswork.
- **Fix:** Add `@Slf4j` to all service classes and log key events (user login, order placed, errors, etc.).

#### C3. No Spring Actuator
- **What:** `spring-boot-starter-actuator` is not included.
- **Why:** There is no `/health`, `/metrics`, or `/readiness` endpoint. Deployment platforms (Docker, Kubernetes) cannot check if the app is alive, and there is no way to observe memory/CPU usage.
- **Fix:** Add `spring-boot-starter-actuator` to `pom.xml` and expose health endpoints.

#### C4. No rate limiting on auth/OTP endpoints
- **What:** `/authorization/login`, `/authorization/register`, and `/authorization/api/v1/otp/generate` have no rate limiting.
- **Why:** Attackers can brute-force passwords or abuse the OTP email sender to spam users and exhaust SMTP quotas.
- **Fix:** Add rate limiting using **Bucket4j** or Spring's built-in throttling on these endpoints.

#### C5. Dockerfile uses full JDK image instead of slim JRE
- **What:** `FROM openjdk:20-jdk` is used. Also, the Java version is 20 in the Dockerfile but 17 in `pom.xml`.
- **Why:** The full JDK image is ~600MB larger than needed. A JRE is sufficient to run a compiled Spring Boot app. The version mismatch can also cause unexpected behavior.
- **Fix:** Use `eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine` to match Java 17 and reduce image size significantly.

---

### Group D — Testing (Medium)

#### D1. Near-zero test coverage
- **What:** Only 2 test files exist — a basic context load test and one `DateTimeUtil` unit test. No tests for controllers, services, or repositories.
- **Why:** Without tests, every code change risks breaking existing behavior silently. Refactoring is dangerous. Bugs are only caught in production.
- **Fix:** Add unit tests for all service classes using JUnit 5 + Mockito. Add integration tests for key API endpoints using `MockMvc` and a test database.

---

### Group E — Database Schema (Low-Medium)

#### E1. OTP tables created at runtime
- **What:** `DatabaseInitializer.java` creates `tb_distributor_otp` and `tb_retailer_otp` tables with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` at every application startup.
- **Why:** Runtime schema creation is fragile, hard to audit, and conflicts with proper migration practices. It also runs on every restart unnecessarily.
- **Fix:** Move these table definitions into a Flyway migration script and remove `DatabaseInitializer`.
